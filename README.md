# Space Explorer

  It is a hyper-casual space game, coded entirely by me from start to finish.
  
  I developed it while taking a game programming course at my university. 
  
  Have fun!


## Mechanics & In-Game Footages

## Moving & Rotating
  The Rocket always moves straight; we can control it by changing its rotation.

  * *Map is horizontally infinite. Planets and power boosts spawn randomly specific distance from previous ones.*

## Obstacles
In the ride of the spaceship, we face different planets that we need to avoid touching.

If we touch the planets, the ship explodes with particle animation.

## Power & Boost System
The power decreases linearly during riding. We can recover it taking power boosts.

## Score System
The score can increase by taking power boosts, and it also increases gradually as we cover distance.
